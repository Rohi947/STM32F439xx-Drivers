# STM32F439xx-Drivers
Bare-metal drivers for STM32F439xx microcontrollers.

## **Inspiration and Acknowledgments**
Some sections of the code in this repository are inspired by the concepts taught in the **FastBit Embedded Brain Academy Udemy Lectures by Kiran Nayak**. These lectures provided a strong foundation for understanding STM32 bare-metal driver development. This repository builds on those concepts with original implementations and extensions tailored to the STM32F439xx series.
